# Build a Markdown Previewer with React.js

This is a simple react app which will contain a textarea for Markdown input and a preview tab where the converted text will appear.\
- What I've learned:
  - Approach React and Redux.
  - Review HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge.
  - Learn to use JS libraries in React&Redux.
- Technologies I use:
  - Reactjs
  - Redux
  - HTML5, CSS3
  - Marked.js

And here's a link to the deployed version: [Markdown Previewer](http://markdown-previewer-reactjs.surge.sh).\
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
